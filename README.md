Connecting to your inverter can be acheived in two ways:  
* Using the inverters LAN port connected to your router/switch (no additional hardware required)  
    
* Connecting to the COM port using a [RS485 to USB](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B078X5H8H7?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_CR8FQK7A50FNCH530QJP) adapter or [WIFI/LAN RS485](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07DNWM62H?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_BPWX7Z53PDES4WJ9JY89) converter  

⚠️ Additional hardware requires basic electronics competencies to connect the two additional wires for the RS485 interface to the inverters com connector.⚠️

<p>The aim of this project is to enable the full use of the Energy dashboard in Home Assistant and is a fully functional replacement of the FoxESS App for reporting needs.</p>

## HACS Specific Installation  
* Add this repository to your HACS custom integrations
* Install from HACS

## Manual Specific installation
* Hardware configuration instructions can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/StealthChesnut/HA-FoxESS-Modbus/wiki/)
* Copy the Required modbus file (USB or LAN) file to /config/custom_components/HA-FoxESS-Modbus/modbusLAN.yaml

## Then, Common Installation Steps

* Create a full backup of your HA instance including the configuration.yaml file
* Copy the Required modbus line (USB or LAN) and following contents of the [configuration.yaml](https://github.com/StealthChesnut/HA-FoxESS-Modbus/blob/main/custom_components/HA-FoxESS-Modbus/configuration.yaml) file to your config file
* For LAN, create your Secrets file entry
* Check your config is valid, then Restart HA
* Map energy dashboard as per below example and enjoy configuring dashboards using near realtime data.
